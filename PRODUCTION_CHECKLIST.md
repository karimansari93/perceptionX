- [x] Unsafe finally prevention

## ðŸ”§ Pre-Deployment Tasks

### Environment Setup
1. Create `.env` file with production values:
   ```bash
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ofyjvfmcgtntwamkubui.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im9meWp2Zm1jZ3RudHdhbWt1YnVpIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDgwNzk1ODgsImV4cCI6MjA2MzY1NTU4OH0.vkzuvNTDMlAS77MHjNDBvBmm0tFGTSPIE7y_Ce3dy2k
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

2. Verify environment variables are not hardcoded in the build

### Security Testing
1. [ ] Test XSS prevention with malicious inputs
2. [ ] Verify CSP headers are working correctly
3. [ ] Test authentication flow with invalid inputs
4. [ ] Verify no sensitive data in client-side logs
5. [ ] Test rate limiting (if implemented server-side)

### Performance & Monitoring
1. [ ] Set up error tracking service (Sentry, LogRocket)
2. [ ] Configure monitoring for security events
3. [ ] Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
4. [ ] Monitor for unusual traffic patterns

## ðŸš¨ Post-Deployment Security Checklist

### Immediate Checks
- [ ] Verify all console statements are removed in production build
- [ ] Confirm environment variables are properly set
- [ ] Test authentication flows work correctly
- [ ] Verify CSP headers are present and working
- [ ] Check that no sensitive data appears in browser console

### Ongoing Security
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Monitor for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Keep all dependencies updated
- [ ] Regular penetration testing
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activities

## ðŸ”’ Additional Security Recommendations

### For Future Implementation
1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting for API calls
2. **Session Management**: Add session timeout and secure session handling
3. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Consider adding 2FA for sensitive operations
4. **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit logging
5. **Data Encryption**: Ensure sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
6. **Regular Backups**: Implement automated backup procedures
7. **Incident Response Plan**: Create a plan for security incidents

### Monitoring & Alerting
1. Set up alerts for:
   - Failed authentication attempts
   - Unusual API usage patterns
   - Security-related errors
   - Performance degradation

2. Regular security reviews:
   - Code security audits
   - Dependency vulnerability scans
   - Penetration testing
   - Security configuration reviews

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Commands

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build:prod

# Verify no console statements in build
grep -r "console\." dist/

# Check for hardcoded sensitive data
grep -r "eyJ" dist/
grep -r "sk_" dist/

# Deploy with proper environment variables
# (Use your deployment platform's specific commands)
```
